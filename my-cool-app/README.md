## Rules

With a group of friends, the person playing can take turns answering a randomly selected
question based on the the two random Marvel characters that appear. Once a character is clicked, the person playing can continue on or choose another group member to take his/her turn.

If the two characters that appear are unknown, the person playing is allowed to roll again (this does not apply to questions based on appearance).
